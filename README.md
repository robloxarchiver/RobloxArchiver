# About Me

I enjoy writing tools for Roblox and games such as Skyrim, Fallout 4 and soon Starfield once the Creation Kit releases. I study Computer Science, Foundation of Web Design and IT, I also happen to dabble a little with Cybersecurity and Penetration Testing, I do not study them though as I have little interest in them. I contribute to Lego Game (Roblox) projects once in awhile at zero cost unlike most people. I love to help people when I can, with anything. I'm an ameteur at everything I do but I try my hardest to push on. 

I do not plan on getting a job technology related, I think I've had enough.
